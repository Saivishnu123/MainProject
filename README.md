# MainProject
Now -a -days although e-books came into existence, many students still prefer manual books. However, buying such books may not be always feasible for them. Moreover, some people may have some books with them which are no longer used. So, our project is to bridge the gap between people in need of books and people having books with them. The main objective of our project is to make books available to students in need for free of cost. Generally passed out students may have some books with them which can be donated to people in need. For this any person having books can update their status to admin regarding availability of book. Admin manages the books available so that users can find the book according to their need. Thus, a user can be either donor or recipient of books. To achieve this, we are using Flutter, an Open-Source UI SDK developed by Google, which uses Dart as the programming language. Dart is an open-source, client-side programming language
